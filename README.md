# Schotter 

Since I enjoy creating art with code and am currently learning Rust, I came across this fantastic tutorial: https://github.com/sidwellr/schotter. It explains how to recreate Schotter, a famous artwork by computer art pioneer Georg Nees.

I have added some other features compare to what it is done in the tutorial.
